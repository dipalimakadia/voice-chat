## voice-chat app
## Overview

This project is a React-based single-page application designed to integrate with Resemble AI's voice cloning technology. Users can input text, select a voice, and generate a speech audio output. The application is built using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your local development machine:
* Node.js (version 14 or higher)
* npm or yarn (package manager)

### Installation
1. Clone the Repository
    Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resemble-ai-react-app.git
    cd resemble-ai-react-app
    ```
   
2. Install Dependencies
    Install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn:
   
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
   
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
   
3. Run the Application

    Start the development server:
   
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
   
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
   
    The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
   
   
### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:
   
Using npm:
```bash
npm start
```


Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn build
```

The production-ready files will be located in the build directory.

## Limitations

- The application can input text and generate audio in different voices, but it's currently limited in scope.
- There is potential to make the application more dynamic with additional features and functionality.
- The application uses mock API calls rather than real API integrations.
- More animations and CSS will be done if time is given.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
